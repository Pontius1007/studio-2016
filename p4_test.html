            <p>Our client is a former musician turned producer, Peter Hansen, that now runs his own music studio.
               As a former artist, Peter has high demands when it comes to creativity and is expecting a website with a nice design
               and artistic layout. After some brainstorming via skype, we feel that we have achieved a good connection with Peter and a mutual 
               understanding of what we all want the website to be.</p>

				<h3>Testing document </h3>

				    <ol>
                        <li>In the first section of the questionnaire the user is asked questions about his choice of webbrowser, operating system and connection speed. Lastly the user is asked about his age in order to get data on the demographics of the users. 
                        </li>
                        <li>In the second section, the user is asked about his impression of the website, which age group he thinks it's aimed at and what purpose he thinks the website is trying to fulfill.
                        </li>
                        <li>In section three, the user is asked to rate the design and the how easy the site is to navigate. After this the user is asked if he ever had trouble finding something, if he felt anything was placed in an illogical manner and if there is anything with the website's design he would like to have changed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        In the final section, the user is asked to rate to what extent he feels the website has fulfilled his expectations and if there is anything at all about the website he would have liked to have changed. Finally the user is asked to rate the questionnaire itself.</li>

			    <div class="box left">
			     <p>In order to get some feedback on our design, a Google form was created asking questions explained in the test document section. This form was spread to mainly coworkers and room mates, but also to the Northern Wave recording studio owners and their friends. Doing it this way, we felt that the base of testers would not only consist of other students and tech savvy persons, but also musicians and business men.

                    Most of our test users (55.6%) were using windows operating systems, 22.2% were on OS-x and 11.1% were using linux or other.
                Most of the test user were using google chrome, the second two most popular browsers were safari and internet explorer. Firefox and Opera was the least used browsers. See below for the full statistic.

            <h4>First impressions</h4>
            The majority of the users liked the website and had a good first impression of it.
            <img src="studio-2016/images/questionaires/q3.PNG">
            <h4>The website's purpose</h4>Almost everyone assumed the website's purpose was to inform the public about the Northern Wave music studio, which was our intent. 
            <img src="studio-2016/images/questionaires/q4.PNG">
            <h4>The design and navigability</h4>On a scale of 1-5 rating the design and the site's navigability , more than 90% of testers rated it 4 or more. Almost 80% of test users had no trouble finding the elements they were looking for. 
            <img src="studio-2016/images/questionaires/q5.PNG">
            <h4>Suggested changes</h4>
            When asked if the test user would want to change anything about the design, we got a mixed response. Some wanted to change the colors, others wouldn't and one left a puzzling response of "yes".
            <img src="studio-2016/images/questionaires/q7.PNG">
            <h4>Expectations and general changes</h4>
            Most test user felt the website fulfilled their expectations, and few had any comments on what to change.
            <img src="studio-2016/images/questionaires/q8.PNG">
            <h4>Summary</h4>
            Overall, the website was well recieved and test users had little feedback on things they would want to be different. We are very pleased with the fact that the inherrent intent with the website was well communicated and recieved. We are especially happy with these results, because of the diversity in the age groups of our testers. They were also browsing using very different internet connections.

            This project taught us how time consuming and intricate group projects can be. We were mostly correct in our scheduling and timing of sub-projects with the exception of our shop feature, which we could have planned better. Generally, we gave out tasks to be completed before a soft-deadline, if a particular task turned out to be too difficult or time consuming for one member, others would chime in to help.
                </p>
             <p>   
            We believe we have more or less achieved our visual design goals for the website with only a few adjustments to some design details. If there is one thing we have learned about html and css through the course of this project is that building a well documented css framework is very important when making a website, in addition the use of the flex-feature have been a great help when it has come to the modularity of the website.
</p>
            <p>For javascript we learned to be aware of browser limitations or syntax variations. The specific problem we encountered was with the use of innerhtml and how internet explorer handled it. A fix that worked on all major browsers was found and no further problems were met.
