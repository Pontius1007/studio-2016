				<p>We are five producers who worked together to open a complete music studio on Marienborg in Trondheim.  We buildt the studio from completely empty rooms and the studio now consist of a recording room, a vokal booth, a controle room and a kitchen/storage place. The acoustic and comfortable design of the controle room got a sofa and a creative atmosfere. In the small kitchen you can make youself a cup of coffe or get a cold beer from the fridge. And the recording room is filled with fantastic instruments for a band who wants to record live.</p>
