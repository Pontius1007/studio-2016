            <p>Our client is a former musician turned producer, Peter Hansen, that now runs his own music studio.
               As a former artist, Peter has high demands when it comes to creativity and is expecting a website with a nice design
               and artistic layout. After some brainstorming via skype, we feel that we have achieved a good connection with Peter and a mutual 
               understanding of what we all want the website to be.</p>
